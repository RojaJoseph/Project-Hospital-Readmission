•	Objective: The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can identify patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission within 30 days after their initial discharge.<!---

1.	Data Preprocessing: This task involves cleaning and preparing the healthcare data. You'll need to handle missing values, perform data normalization or scaling, and deal with categorical variables.
2.	Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that can be used for predictive modeling. This may involve extracting patient demographics, medical history, previous hospitalizations, and other relevant information.
3.	Model Building: Develop a machine learning or statistical model that can predict the likelihood of hospital readmission within 30 days. Common approaches include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or more advanced models like gradient boosting or neural networks.
4.	Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
